# Remote Control Lifts

Control your lifts using a handy remote. **We're in the future!!!**

Defaults are `R` for Lift 1 and `P` for Lift 2
The shortcuts will both raise and lower the lifts, they will not put the car on the ground 
(e.g. shortcut will raise from middle position to top position and top position to middle position)

You can change these defaults by modifying 
`Car Mechanic Simulator 2021\UserData\MelonPreferences.cfg` 

If you are in the way of the lift it will not move, e.g. don't
stand under it...
