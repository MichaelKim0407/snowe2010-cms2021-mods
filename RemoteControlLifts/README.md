# Remote Control Lifts

Control your lifts using a handy remote. **We're in the future!!!**

Defaults are `R` for Lift 1 and `P` for Lift 2

You can change these defaults by modifying 
`Car Mechanic Simulator 2021\UserData\MelonPreferences.cfg` 

If you are in the way of the lift it will not move, e.g. don't
stand under it...


# Installation:
